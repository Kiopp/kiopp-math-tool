# kiopps-math-tool
A command line application written in pure C for advanced/semi advanced math calculations and operations. 

## Features
- **Classic Divided Differences:** A simple tool for calculating the entire divided differences table. Can take 1 or more data points as input. The data points consist of a variable(x) and the function(y) value at that point.

- **Max LP Simplex:** A simple tool for calculating max LP problems using the Simplex method. Input the objective function's coefficients, the restriction's coefficients and RHS. Prints both the initial tableau and the final tableau. 

## Compilation
Compilation can easily be done using any C-compiler as I am only using standard or included libraries. I am using gcc. And have only tested the program on an arch-based linux distribution btw.
