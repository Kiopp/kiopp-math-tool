# kiopps-math-tool
A command line application written in pure C for advanced/semi advanced math calculations and operations. 

## Features
### Classic Divided Differences
A simple tool for calculating the entire divided differences table. Can take 1 or more data points as input. The data points consist of a variable(x) and the function(y) value at that point.

### Classic Newton Interpolation
**Not yet implemented**
A simple tool for calculating the Newton interpolation between data points. Behind the scenes this tool will use divided differences and will thus have the same input parameters.

## Compilation
Compilation can easily be done using any C-compiler as I am only using standard or included libraries. I am using gcc. And have only tested the program on an arch-based linux distribution.
