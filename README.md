# kiopps-math-tool
A command line application written in pure C for special math calculations and operations. 

## Features
- **Classic Divided Differences:** A simple tool for calculating an entire divided differences table. Can take 1 or more data points as input. The data points consist of a variable(x) and the function(y) value at that point.

- **Max LP Simplex:** A simple tool for calculating normal max LP problems using the Simplex method. Input the objective function's coefficients, the restriction's coefficients and RHS. Prints both the initial tableau and the final tableau. 

## Compilation
Compilation should be easy and straight-forward on any system that has a C-compiler. I only use the standard libraries, or libraries included in the project. Personally I am using gcc. And have only tested the program on an arch-based linux distribution (btw).
